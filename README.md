Galactic Empires
=====================

A Sci-Fi 4x Game

To build, download/install premake (version 4.4 beta 5 was used)

Run "premake4 --help" to view a list of build options.

Run one of them (e.g. "premake4 codeblocks") in the same directory as the premake4.lua file.

You will find your build in the "builds/" folder.
